                <h6 class="color-gray fs-14">Jul 21, 2021, 12:38pm EDT|</h6>
                <p>
                 I’ve finally been able to travel and have had the
                  opportunity to hear from CPA firms, small and medium business
                  owners and tax-exempt organization managers around the country
                  about their outlook for jobs and growth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Most of the news has
                  been heartening as businesses and tax-exempts look to weather
                  the economic storm caused by the pandemic. However, it has
                  been jaw- dropping to see how many business firms (and often
                  CPAs) as well as tax-exempt organizations are failing to take
                  advantage of the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) – meant to
                  help businesses and tax-exempt organizations keep the doors
                  open and maintain jobs, or, even better, grow and expand (and
                  create more jobs) during these tough economic times. 
                </p>
                <p>
                The
                  failure of business owners and tax-exempt managers to take
                  advantage of the ERC is due to fundamental misunderstandings
                  and confusion about the credit. Congress’ Joint Committee on
                  Taxation (JCT) scored the ERC as an approximately $80
                  billion-dollar temporary tax benefit for small and medium
                  businesses and tax-exempt organizations. Given what I’m
                  hearing, I fear that business owners and tax-exempt managers
                  are leaving billions of dollars on the table by failing to
                  consider whether they qualify for the ERC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                I’ve written
                  previously about the
                  <span>
                    Top Ten Mistakes Of Business Owners And Their Advisors
                  </span>
                  make on the ERC – but I realize now that the core problem is
                  that business owners and tax exempt managers (as well as many
                  CPAs) do not understand the goal Congress was intending to
                  accomplish with this $80 billion dollar tax credit.
                </p>
                <h4>ERC Is About Jobs</h4>
                <p>
                  The ERC is about jobs. The incentive was put in place to help
                  businesses and tax- exempts retain jobs, keep jobs, but more
                  importantly, GROW AND EXPAND jobs. Congress – in passing the
                  ERC – wanted to help not only the businesses and tax- exempts
                  that were set back by the pandemic. However, Congress also
                  wanted to support and assist those businesses and tax-exempts
                  that found ways to thrive in the pandemic – and were
                  maintaining or creating new jobs. When Congress wrote the $80
                  billion dollar check for the ERC – it was to help job creation
                  across the board – job creation by struggling businesses; job
                  creation by businesses treading water, and job creation by
                  businesses that are fortunate to move forward. For Congress.
                  it is all about the jobs.
                </p>
                <h4>ERC Has Been Expanded</h4>
                <p>
                  A source of confusion or uncertainty as to the ERC is that
                  people have an outdated understanding of the law from when it
                  was first put in place in Spring 2020. The ERC has been
                  significantly expanded and extended since it was first
                  included as part of the 2020 COVID-19 relief bill in Spring
                  2020 – and the same legislation included the Paycheck
                  Protection Program (“PPP”) loan program (with the PPP loan
                  program getting the vast majority of the attention and being
                  viewed as an either/or with ERC). Since Spring 2020, the ERC
                  has been extended and expanded twice and made much more
                  generous (and easier) for businesses and tax exempts to
                  qualify. It is not your grandmother’s ERC – with a credit now
                  of up to $7,000 per quarter per employee for all of 2021 and
                  friendly rules for interaction with PPP loans.
                </p>
                <h4>ERC – The Second Way to Qualify</h4>
                <p>
                  I repeatedly find that business owners, tax-exempt managers
                  and CPAs incorrectly believe that a business must see a 50%
                  reduction in revenues to qualify – not true. There are two
                  different ways to qualify – a revenue test; and, alternatively
                  a test as to whether your business or tax-exempt was impacted
                  by government orders (which include being subject to a partial
                  or full shutdown due to a government order at the federal,
                  state, city, county or other local level) that led to a more
                  than nominal impact on the operations of your business or tax-
                  exempt entity. (NOTE: There have been over 10,000 federal,
                  state, city, county or other local government orders impacting
                  business in response to the pandemic). 
                </p>
                <p>
                Thus, while a reduction
                  in revenues is one way to qualify for the ERC – in our own
                  work we are seeing hundreds of businesses and tax-exempt
                  organizations qualify for the ERC because they meet the
                  alternative test – of a more than nominal impact on operations
                  due to being impacted by government orders (including partial
                  or full government shut down). The IRS has helpfully put out a
                  102-page <span>notice</span> about how to qualify). The Key:
                  documenting today in detail how your company or tax-exempt
                  organization qualifies for the ERC.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Which Businesses/Tax Exempts Are Good Candidates For The ERC?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  All of them. We have found across-the-board companies and
                  tax-exempts from all walks that qualify for the ERC –
                  including manufacturers; construction; engineering;
                  architecture; dental; medical; hotels, restaurants; churches;
                  schools; hair salons; agriculture; food and beverage;
                  hospitals; charities. Even for a very small business or
                  tax-exempt the savings can be meaningful. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Just to give you a
                  flavor – I’ve seen: 1) Food and Beverage company with 317
                  employees received a credit for 1st quarter of 2021 of $1.03
                  million; 2) Dental Lab with 17 employees receive a credit for
                  $60,000 for 1st quarter of 2021; 3) Construction business with
                  425 employees receive a credit of $1.61 million for 1st
                  quarter of 2021; and, 4) Agriculture Feed Company, 33
                  employees, $123,000 credit for 1st quarter of 2021. For all
                  these businesses the credit has been extremely important to
                  keep jobs, retain jobs and, yes, create new jobs – great news
                  for workers. Just as Congress intended.
                </p>
                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <p>
                  I understand that many businesses have shied away from the PPP
                  loan program because of the publicity surrounding the program.
                  For those concerned about the spotlight, they should be aware
                  that the ERC is part of your business tax returns and is
                  confidential information.
                </p>
                <h4>Bottom Line</h4>
                <p>
                  The ERC is an $80 billion dollar tax program that hundreds of
                  thousands of small and medium businesses and tax-exempt
                  entities – that are good candidates for the ERC – are failing
                  to consider. Business owners and tax-exempt managers are
                  losing out on significant tax benefits – benefits that can
                  help retain jobs and create new jobs. Unfortunately, the
                  biggest losers are the workers who would benefit from a
                  business or tax-exempt maintaining a job or the creation of a
                  new job. The ERC: it’s worth a hard look.

                <h2>Employee retention credit: Opportunities remain</h2>
                <h4>By Maria L. Murphy, CPA</h4>
                <p>November 9, 2021</p>
                <p>
                  The employee retention tax credit (ERC) has been valuable for
                  some, but seemingly out of reach for others. "It is a really
                  powerful credit that at a high level seems pretty easy, but
                  there are a lot of twists and turns to the implementation,"
                  said Courtney Vitale, CPA, tax director at CBIZ MHM LLC.
                  <br /><br />
                  "There is a diversity of understanding, but there is real
                  value in understanding how the credit applies to your business
                  because, even if you didn't understand it or think you were
                  eligible, you can still file for it," Vitale, who is scheduled
                  to present a session on the ERC on Dec. 8 at the AICPA &amp; CIMA
                  Construction and Real Estate Conference
                  <a href="https://cor.aicpastore.com"
                    >(https://cor.aicpastore.com/)</a
                  >
                  in Las Vegas, said during a preconference telephone interview.
                  <br /><br />
                  The ERC was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
                  Economic Security (CARES) Act, P.L. 116-136, in March 2020. It
                  was intended to help businesses retain their workforces and
                  avoid layoffs during the coronavirus pandemic. It provides a
                  per employee credit to eligible businesses based on a
                  percentage of qualified wages and health insurance benefits
                  paid to employees. <br /><br />
                  The CARES Act did not allow businesses that received Paycheck
                  Protection Program (PPP) loans to also claim the ERC, but the
                  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, P.L. 116-260, which was
                  enacted at the end of 2020, retroactively removed the
                  limitation so employers that had applied for or received PPP
                  loans could still get the ERC. <br /><br />
                  In March 2021, the IRS issued detailed guidance (Notice
                  2021-20) about the ERC to address specific questions about
                  eligibility requirements and calculations. <br /><br />
                  "The ERC is a federal credit from the IRS taken on businesses'
                  quarterly payroll tax returns using Form 941, and it is not
                  the kind of credit that gets passed through to shareholders,"
                  Vitale said. "The credit calculation is based on how many
                  employees you had for the time period when you were eligible
                  for the credit." <br /><br />
                  Although the American Rescue Plan Act, P.L. 117-2, provided
                  that the ERC would go through Dec. 31, 2021, infrastructure
                  legislation awaiting President Joe Biden's signature (H.R.
                  3684) includes a provision that will end the ERC for many
                  businesses after Sept. 30, 2021, rather than Dec. 31, 2021.
                  <br /><br />
                  Once Biden signs the infrastructure legislation, it will
                  repeal the ERC for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021. The
                  third-quarter Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax
                  Return, will be the final quarter eligible to be amended, and
                  beginning Oct. 1, 2021, the ERC will be considered terminated
                  with an applicable exception related to eligible recovery
                  startup businesses.<br /><br />
                  Vitale shared some highlights of the ERC provisions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    It is a refundable payroll tax credit claimed quarterly, and
                    it can provide reductions to payroll taxes or cash refunds.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It is available to both for-profit and not-for-profit
                    employers, but not every business is eligible.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are two critical tests for eligibility — a partial or
                    total government-ordered shutdown, or the applicable decline
                    in gross receipts.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are two categories of eligible employer — small or
                    large — defined in the ERC, based on the average number of
                    full-time employees in 2019 pre-COVID-19.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The decline in gross receipts test is based on a
                    "significant" decline in gross receipts in quarters of 2020
                    (more than 50%) and 2021 (more than 20%) compared with the
                    same quarters in 2019.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There are different rules for 2020 and 2021. "The ERC for
                    2020 was a little more confined, but for 2021 it was more
                    expansive and opened up to more possibility and higher
                    dollars," Vitale said. At a high level, for wages paid after
                    March 12, 2020, and on or before Dec. 31, 2020, the credit
                    is equal to 50% of qualified wages with a $10,000 maximum
                    per employee ($5,000) for the year 2020. For wages paid Jan.
                    1, 2021, through Sept. 30, 2021, the credit increases to 70%
                    of qualified wages, but the $10,000 maximum per employee is
                    considered for each quarter (so the maximum credit is $7,000
                    per quarter, or $21,000 for three quarters) rather than
                    annually.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There is no cap on the number of employees that are paid in
                    any quarterly period for purposes of the ERC.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Vitale encourages every business to become more familiar with
                  the ERC provisions to determine if they are eligible for it,
                  because it can provide substantial amounts of money based on
                  the number of employees and how many quarters the business was
                  eligible. <br /><br />
                  "There are nuances to maximize the program, so every business
                  should find out about it and evaluate the opportunities," she
                  said. "Even if you missed it or didn't completely understand
                  it, but you now find you were eligible, you can still file an
                  amended Form 941 for prior quarters, utilize the program, and
                  not leave money on the table." <br /><br />

                <h6 class="color-gray fs-14">Jul 21, 2021, 12:38pm EDT|</h6>
                <p>
                  The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) has proven to be one of
                  the most effective tax policies in helping small and medium
                  businesses and tax-exempt entities weather the economic impact
                  of the pandemic. The ERC provides employers up to $7,000 per
                  employee per quarter in refundable tax relief for the first
                  three quarters of 2021 (and a reduced benefit for 2020).
                  <br /><br />
                  The IRS management anticipated that approximately 70%-80% of
                  small and medium businesses (as well as tens of thousands of
                  charities) were good candidates for taking the ERC. The
                  reality is — to date the actual numbers of businesses and
                  charities applying for the ERC — is far below that. Small and
                  medium businesses (as well as taxexempts/charities) are
                  leaving billions of dollars on the table. <br /><br />
                  As I’ve written in the past – the ERC is a misunderstood tax
                  benefit – with small and medium business owners and managers
                  of charities either not knowing about the ERC or being wrong
                  (or more likely outdated) about what they do know.
                  <br /><br />
                  In addition, employers often don’t appreciate that there are
                  basically two ways you can qualify for the ERC: 1) reduction
                  in revenues; and, 2) if your business/charity has had a more
                  than nominal impact due to federal, state, local government or
                  regulatory covid orders (easy example, think of occupancy,
                  spacing, cleaning requirements as just a start of a long
                  list). <br /><br />
                  Finally, some business owners and charity managers wrongly
                  think ERC is only for entities that are in distress/under
                  water. No. Congress viewed this provision as a means of
                  encouraging businesses and charities to retain employees and
                  hire new employees – helping to weather the economic hardships
                  and costs brought by Covid. <br /><br />
                  In practice, alliantgroup has found that an extremely broad
                  range of businesses are good candidates for the ERC –
                  including restaurants, manufacturing, construction, food
                  industry, healthcare – and when it comes to charities/tax
                  exempts – churches, museums, food kitchens, schools, are just
                  the start of the list
                </p>
                <h5>ERC – Congress Reinstate Fourth Quarter 2021?</h5>
                <p>
                  There has been more smoke lately about Congress looking at
                  considering a covid/emergency relief bill – and that
                  reinstating the fourth quarter of ERC is under consideration
                  to be included in the package. <br /><br />
                  Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD) has been a leader on a possible
                  covid relief and has been open to ERC. In addition, a
                  bipartisan group of House members – led by Congresswoman
                  Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) as well as Congresswoman Carol Miller
                  (R- WV); and Congressmen Kevin Hern (R-OK) and Terri Sewell
                  (D-AL) introduced legislation that would reinstate the fourth
                  quarter of ERC. In the Senate – Senators Maggie Hassan (D-NH)
                  and Tim Scott (R-SC) have dropped into the hopper similar
                  legislation. <br /><br />
                  As important, a coalition of over 70 associations and
                  organizations has recently stated its support of extending ERC
                  for the fourth quarter. Finally, individual business owners
                  and charities are contacting their elected officials on the
                  ERC and it is clearly having an impact. <br /><br />
                  Fingers crossed.
                </p>
                <h5>IRS Processing and Guidance</h5>
                <p>
                  Processing of ERC credits for businesses and tax-exempts has
                  been caught up in the general grind of work at the IRS.
                  However, some members of Congress, notably Senator Kirsten
                  Gillibrand (D-NY) have written to the IRS asking them to
                  address this problem. My hope is that with the IRS senior
                  management now focused on dealing with the filing backlog –
                  that this issue will be resolved. <br /><br />
                  Separately, to the IRS’ credit, they did recently issue a
                  helpful comparison sheet – that is useful in illuminating the
                  different changes that have been made overtime to the rules
                  regarding ERC. One of the mistakes business owners and
                  charitable managers have made is not understanding that
                  Congress has changed the rules of the ERC several times in the
                  short period of its existence – primarily for the better. In
                  addition, IRS has put out a significant amount of taxpayer-
                  friendly guidance on the ERC. <br /><br />
                  For many business owners and managers of tax-exempts – the ERC
                  remains the go-to relief from the pandemic. Yet hundreds of
                  thousands of businesses and charities across the country are
                  failing to take advantage of the ERC. Billions of dollars are
                  available for businesses and charities to retain employees and
                  hire new employees. But you have to apply. <br /><br />
